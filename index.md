<br /> This project is about how the pandemic impact the manufacturing housing market. The link is the beginning part about merging tables and cleaning data. I mainly modified comlumn names to have data from different years properly merged.

<br /> This research is about analysis on law firms' performance with Data from the NALP website. My work is solving problems with missing values in Excel, collecting more data,  and consolidating them into firm-level. This link is almost the final work, and I was combing different years of data and getting them ready for consolidation in Excel.
